        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <div class="story-content">
            <p>785 million people in the world live without clean water. That's roughly 1 in 10 people on earth.</p>
            <p>We're working to change that. We build sustainable, community-owned water projects around the world.</p>
            <p>When a community gets access to clean water, it can change everything. It improves health, increases access to food, grows local economies, and helps kids spend more time in school.</p>

                In Madagascar, millions lack access to clean water. Through our projects, we're helping communities install sustainable water solutions that transform lives. Each well serves hundreds of people, providing clean, safe water for generations to come.
